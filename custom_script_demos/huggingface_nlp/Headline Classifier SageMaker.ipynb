    "\n",
    "Some benefits of this approach as compared to the companion [Headline Classifier Local notebook](Headline%20Classifier%20Local.ipynb) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We can automatically provision specialist computing resources (e.g. high-performance, or GPU-accelerated instances) for **only** the duration of the training job: Getting good performance in training, without leaving resources sitting around under-utilized\n",
    "- The history of training jobs (including parameters, metrics, outputs, etc.) is automatically tracked - unlike local notebook experiments where the user needs to keep notes on what worked and what didn't\n",
    "- Our trained model can be deployed to a secure, production-ready web endpoint with just one SDK call: No container or web application packaging required, unless we want to deeply customize the behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "By comparing the local notebook with this SageMaker version and the accompanying [scripts/train.py](scripts/train.py) script file, you can get an idea of how to migrate your own or open-source in-notebook ML workflows into SageMaker \"script mode\" training jobs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next \"migration challenge\" exercise of this workshop, you'll try to repeat this process for a different \"local\" notebook on your own.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might also be interested in [aws-samples/amazon-sagemaker-from-idea-to-production](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-sagemaker-from-idea-to-production), which shows further steps like connecting your SageMaker jobs together into pipelines, and automating workflows with CI/CD."
