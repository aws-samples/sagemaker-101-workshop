    "In this notebook, we saw an example of:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Running your own Scikit-Learn-based model training script as a SageMaker training job, with configurable parameters and output accuracy metrics\n",
    "- Deploying the trained model to a real-time inference API\n",
    "- Using the model for batch inference\n",
    "\n",
    "SageMaker took care of the model serving stack for us with no boilerplate code required: Just define [override functions](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/frameworks/sklearn/using_sklearn.html#sagemaker-scikit-learn-model-server) if needed (like `input_fn` and `model_fn`) to customize the default behaviour. At training time, our script read parameters from the command line arguments and environment variables provided through SageMaker - and loaded data from local folder because download from S3 is taken care of by SageMaker too.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using the SageMaker APIs (instead of just working locally in the notebook), we can improve the traceability and reproducibility of experiments; optimize our compute resource usage; and accelerate the path from trained model to production deployment."
