    "These containers take care of basic setup like GPU drivers, serving stack implementation, core libraries, and so on - leaving us free to simply inject some Python scripts for the training process and any inference behaviour overrides. We can even provide a *requirements.txt* file to specify additional dependencies to be dynamically installed at start-up - without having to build these into the container image.\n",

    "\n",
    "When Amazon SageMaker runs training, your training script (entry_point input) is run just like a regular Python program. A number of files are laid out for your use, under a `/opt/ml` directory.
