    "The goal of this workshop is to serve as a **Minimum Viable Example about SageMaker**, teaching you how to do a **basic ML training** and **Hyper-Parameter Optimization (HPO)** in AWS. Teaching an in-depth Data Science approach is out of the scope of this workshop. We hope that you can use it as a starting point and modify it according to your future projects. \n",

    "## Background (problem description and approach)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Direct marketing**: contacting potential new customers via mail, email, phone call etc. \n",
    "- **Challenge**: A) too many potential customers. B) limited resources of the approacher (time, money etc.).\n",
    "- **Problem: Which are the potential customers with the higher chance of becoming actual customers**? (so as to focus the effort only on them). \n",
    "- **Our setting**: A bank who wants to predict *whether a customer will enroll for a term deposit, after one or more phone calls*.\n",
    "- **Our approach**: Build a ML model to do this prediction, from readily available information e.g. demographics, past interactions etc. (features).\n",
    "- **Our tools**: We will be using the **XGBoost** algorithm in AWS **SageMaker**, followed by **Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO)** to produce the best model.\n",

    "- The **S3 bucket** and **prefix** that you want to use for training and model data. **This should be within the same region as SageMaker training**!\n",

    "* **alpha**: L1 regularization term on weights. Increasing this value makes models more conservative. \n",
    "* **min_child_weight**: Minimum sum of instance weight (hessian) needed in a child. If the tree partition step results in a leaf node with the sum of instance weight less than min_child_weight, the building process gives up further partitioning. In linear regression models, this simply corresponds to a minimum number of instances needed in each node. The larger the algorithm, the more conservative it is. \n",

For each hyperparameter tuning job, we will specify the maximum number of HPO tries (`max_jobs`) and how many of these can happen in parallel (`max_parallel_jobs`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Tip: `max_parallel_jobs` creates a **trade-off between parformance and speed** (better hyperparameter values vs how long it takes to find these values). If `max_parallel_jobs` is large, then HPO is faster, but the discovered values may not be optimal. Smaller `max_parallel_jobs` will increase the chance of finding optimal values, but HPO will take more time to finish.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we'll specify the objective metric that we'd like to tune and its definition, which includes the regular expression (Regex) needed to extract that metric from the CloudWatch logs of the training job. Since we are using built-in XGBoost algorithm here, it emits two predefined metrics: **validation:auc** and **train:auc**, and we elected to monitor *validation:auc* as you can see below. In this case, we only need to specify the metric name and do not need to provide regex.  \n",
    "\n",
